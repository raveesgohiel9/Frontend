# Frontend
This is just a simple example of Mobile first design coded from scratch. This UI is not beautiful but it is 100% responsive. This is used to display my coding style. I can convert pdf to html. It has been created using Flex property of CSS3. I have also used Jquery for adding some interactivity.
